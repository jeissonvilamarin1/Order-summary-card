## My process
- iÂ´ve been learning the funadmentals of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This is my first project with only HTMl and css.
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned how to use the overflow to cut the image when is exceeding the block that is containing it, also how to center the block with margin: 0 auto;


### Continued development

I'm still learniing how to use properly css grid and flexbox, in the next project i want to implement some javascript manipulating the DOM.
